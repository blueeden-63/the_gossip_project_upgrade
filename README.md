# The Gossip Project, the first views
We're going to ask you to build a simple application, which will involve manipulating links and routes. And quickly build the controller.

1. Introduction
Note: the project is to be done in pair programming.

Welcome to your first awesome Rails application! Today you're going to start a project that will take you all week: The Gossip Project. We're going to ask you to take last week's backend (modifying a few elements), then you'll add the right controllers and views so that by the end of the week you can gossip to your heart's content.

Here's the schedule for the week:

Today will be devoted to the first pages of the application: a few static pages and the gossip pages.
Tomorrow will be devoted to creating a piece of gossip
Wednesday will be devoted to the complete CRUD of gossip
Thursday will be devoted to gossip comments, gossip likes, and user management
Friday will be devoted to gossip identification
This program basically consists of adding controllers and views to the solid models you coded last week. How to add the front end to databases. Then next week we'll look at advanced techniques, such as sending emails, managing profile photos, and managing the front end, so that you come out of these three weeks of Rails with a professional result.

2. The project
Today, we'll start by creating the first pages:

The home page, of course. This home page will display all the gossip that has been created.
The page that introduces The Gossip Project team, aka you and your partner.
The contact page where you'll post a great contact address.
A welcome page, which greets the user based on the name entered in the URL
On the home page, it will be possible to click on each piece of gossip to “See more,” which will take you to the gossip page.

Finally, since it's you, we're going to put CSS in the site, thanks in particular to Bootstrap.
